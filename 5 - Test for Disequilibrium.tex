To achieve this aim I have designed a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). The predominant method for examining aspects of sequences' evolution is through the use of \glspl{Substitution model}. \Gls{Maximum Likelihood} methods allow for measuring the support for a hypothesis, (in this case, a \gls{model}), given some data. Whether one hypothesis is better supported than another can be evaluated by using an LRT. Two models fundamental for my LRT are General Nucleotide (GN) and General Nucleotide Stationary (GNS). Their point of difference is that the parameters of a GNS rate matrix must satisfy $\pi\mathbf{Q}=0$, i.e., the process is constrained to be stationary (and thus in equilibrium). Consider an LRT in which GNS is the null and GN is the alternate. If we reject the null, we may conclude that the sequences are more likely to have been generated by a process which is not yet stationary, as this is the only component unique to the alternate.

An LRT as described above is too naive for my objective to test for equilibrium in a single lineage. For a model to be \gls{identifiable} requires an alignment of at least three sequences \cite{Chang1996FullConsistency}. Consequently, a significant result for such an LRT will not reveal which of the taxa is causing the rejection of the null. To test for disequilibrium in a single \gls{edge} requires  modelling a continuous-time process on the edge of interest (herein the foreground edge) and assuming discrete-time processes for the other edges (herein the background edges) \cite{Verbyla2013TheSubstitution}. A discrete-time process is more general (fewer assumptions) than even the GN, making it the ideal background. 

Using mixed discrete- and continuous-time Markov processes, I can test for disequilibrium on a single edge. For such an LRT, the foreground edge assumes GNS for the null, and GN for the alternate. Both hypotheses assume a Barry and Hartigan (BH) model, the most commonly implemented discrete-time process, for the background edges. The modelling of the foreground edge, set apart by the assumption of stationarity, is the only point of difference between hypotheses. For this LRT, a rejection of the null means that the foreground edge was described significantly better with a non-stationary process. Such a result suggests disequilibrium precisely in the foreground edge. Put explicitly, the test will be between the following hypotheses:\\ $\mathbf{H_0}$: the foreground evolved according to the \textbf{GNS}, the background according to BH. \\ $\mathbf{H_1}$: the foreground evolved according to the \textbf{GN}, the background according to BH.\\
\noindent Herein all model fits assume mixed discrete- and continuous-time Markov processes, and a BH process is always assumed for the background edges. For brevity, I will refer to a model by the process assumed on the foreground edge.

It is important that the best possible methods of model fitting are chosen. Recall that a necessary precursor to any application of my test is to establish maximal fits of the models. Additionally, the process of fitting a model to an alignment is the most time-consuming method routinely used in my project. I have sought to identify the quickest possible method that yields a maximised likelihood. 

For this, I conducted an initialisation experiment that makes use of a property of \gls{nested} models. For nested models, it is guaranteed that the likelihood for the alternate will be greater or equal to that for the null. General Time-Reversible (GTR) is the most general time-reversible process, and is required for my initialisation experiment. GTR is nested in GNS, which in turn is nested in GN. When a model is not maximally fit, the optimisation methods have failed to find the global maximum. Such is referred to as a local maximum, where they are higher points elsewhere but not nearby. In such cases, getting parameter estimates from a nested model fit to use as initial estimates may aid the optimisation in escaping a local maximum. I also wish to establish whether there is a speed gain in initialised model fits compared to uninitialised fits. Theoretically, if given starting values close to the optimal, this may reduce the time it takes to get there. 

For all synthetic data sets, I tested whether initialisation improved the model fitting process. The initialised method fit models in order of increasing generality (GTR, GNS, GN). Importantly, parameter estimates for each model were obtained from the previous model. The uninitialised method fit GNS and GN separately. The maximum likelihood estimates between uninitialised and initialised fits were compared for the models (e.g., uninitialised GN vs initialised GN). The time taken for each fitting process was recorded.  

The initialisation experiment revealed that there are no intrinsic problems with the fitting process for GN or GNS. A fit was considered non-maximal if the log-likelihood from the initialised method was higher than that of the uninitialised method. There were no occurrences of non-maximal fits for any of the synthetic alignments. Initialised fits which were faster than the corresponding uninitialised fits were rare, occurring at a rate of about ~1\%. These results suggest that the best method of fitting for both models is without initialisation.
