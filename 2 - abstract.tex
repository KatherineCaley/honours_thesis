    \textbf{Abstract}
    
    Most models of sequence divergence assume the composition of nucleotides does not change through time. This assumption requires a state of mutation equilibrium which is almost impossible if the processes affecting mutagenesis change through time. Considerable empirical evidence strongly suggests that this may be incorrect. In this honours thesis, I have addressed this possibility through developing the following statistical measures: a test for the existence of mutation disequilibrium, a test of its equivalence and a measurement of the magnitude of mutation disequilibrium. I used careful construction of edge cases with simulated data to establish the consistency of the statistics with theoretical expectations. I applied the statistics to empirical data from cases with striking prior evidence for recent perturbations affecting: an entire genome (loss of DNA methylation in \textit{Drosophila melanogaster}); or, a small genomic segment (\textit{Fxy} in \textit{Mus musculus}). Using paired experimental designs, I show the predicted vast excess of small probabilities from the statistical tests. I further show the statistical measure of magnitude is also elevated in these cases. Applying the methods to Human evolution, I conservatively estimate $>$ 50\% of our genome is in mutation disequilibrium.
