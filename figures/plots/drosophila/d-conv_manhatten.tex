\caption{\textbf{The pattern of elevated mutation disequilibrium in \textit{D. melanogaster} compared to \textit{D. simulans} is systematic across the genome}. Manhattan plots the position of a gene in a chromosome and the $\hat\delta_\nabla$ for the CDS sequence of that gene. The CDS sequence is third codon position only. The median $\hat\delta_\nabla$ is indicated for a chromosome with a horizontal line. The number of genes included in the plots of chromosome 2, 3, and X of \textit{D. melanogaster} is 2373, 2624 and 818 respectively. For chromosome 2, 3, and X of \textit{D. simulans}, the number of genes is 2388, 2623 and 800 respectively.}
