\caption[The mutagenic process was not distinguishable between \textit{D. melanogaster} and \textit{D. simulans}]{\textbf{The mutagenic process was not distinguishable between \textit{D. melanogaster} and \textit{D. simulans}.} The Quantile-Quantile plots compare the distribution of the temporal EOP between genes in \textit{D. melanogaster} and their ortholog in \textit{D. simulans} to  to the uniform distribution. The data points fall close to the diagonal indicating that the distribution is almost identical to what we would expect if the null was true. The plot shows 5,942 third codon position CDS alignments from \textit{D. melanogaster}, \textit{D. simulans} and \textit{D. yakubra}. }
