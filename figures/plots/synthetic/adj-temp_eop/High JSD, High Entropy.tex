\caption{The equivalence of process tests are consistent with theoretical approximations. The Quantile-Quantile plots compare the distribution of $\hat p-$values to the uniform distribution. As the data points (shown as the orange line) fall very close to the diagonal, this demonstrates that the distribution of $\hat p-$values is almost indistinguishable from the uniform distribution. (a) $\hat p-$values from temporal equivalence of process, (b) $\hat p-$values from adjacent equivalence of process. }
