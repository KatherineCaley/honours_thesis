\caption[The test statistic presented in \cite{Squartini2008QuantifyingProcess} is not consistent with the theoretical distribution]{\textbf{The test statistic presented in \cite{Squartini2008QuantifyingProcess} is not consistent with the theoretical distribution} The Quantile-Quantile plots compare the distribution of $\hat p-$values to the uniform distribution. The data points indicate that the test is excessively rejecting the null hypothesis, in data where the null is true. (a), (b) and (c) show the High JSD, Low Entropy seed for alignments for length $300$, $3,000$ and $30,000$ respectively. (d), (e) and (f) show the High JSD, High Entropy seed for alignments for length $300$, $3,000$ and $30,000$ respectively. (g), (h) and (i) show the Low JSD, Low Entropy seed for alignments for length $300$, $3,000$ and $30,000$ respectively. (i), (j) and (k) shows the Low JSD, High Entropy seed for alignments for length $300$, $3,000$ and $30,000$ respectively.}
