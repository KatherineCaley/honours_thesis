\caption{\textbf{Increasing the branch length to by a factor of 3 does not change the distribution of LRT p-values.} Quantile-Quantile plot comparing the distribution of the LRT p-values to the uniform distribution. \textbf{a}, simulated alignments of length 3000, \textbf{b}, simulated alignments of length 3000 with branch lengths scaled by a factor of 3. The data set was generated from the high JSD, high entropy seed.}
