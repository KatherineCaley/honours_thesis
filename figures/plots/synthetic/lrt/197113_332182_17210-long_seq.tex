\caption{\textbf{Increasing the length of sequences gives a distribution of p-values closer to theoretical expectations.} Quantile-Quantile plots comparing the \textit{p}-value distribution of the test for disequilibrium to the uniform distribution. \textbf{a}, synthetic alignments of length 300, \textbf{b}, synthetic alignments of length 30000. Both data sets are generated from the same high JSD, high entropy seed. Results for other seeds are very similar}
