\caption{\textbf{The transformed statistic, $\delta_\nabla$, corrects for error introduced by the length of the alignment.} \textbf{(a)} The original statistic, $\nabla$, had both a higher level of variation and a higher expected value in shorter sequences. \textbf{(b)} The transformed statistic $\delta_\nabla$ corrects for the location of the expected value only. The variation in shorter sequences remains, however, the mean for alignments of all lengths is centred on zero.}
