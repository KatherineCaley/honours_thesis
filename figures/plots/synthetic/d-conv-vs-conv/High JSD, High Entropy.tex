\caption{\textbf{The transformed statistic, $\delta_\nabla$, corrects for error introduced by the length of the alignment.} The violin plots show the distribution of $\hat \delta_\nabla$ for simulated data sets of alignment length 300bp, 3,000bp, and 30,000bp. \textbf{(a)} The original statistic, $\nabla$, \textbf{(b)} The transformed statistic $\delta_\nabla$. Each data set contains 1,000 synthetic stationary alignments. The High JSD, High Entropy seed is shown, however, this result was the same for all seeds ( Figure \ref{fig:synthetic/conv/all_seeds}).}
