\caption[$T_{50}$ was prone to sampling error in short alignments, especially in low entropy data]{\textbf{$T_{50}$ is prone to sampling error in short alignments, especially in low entropy data.} The violin plots show the distribution of $\hat T_{50}$ in the simulated stationary data sets of alignment length 300bp, 3,000bp, and 30,000bp. Each data set contains 1,000 synthetic stationary alignments. The data sets are generated by the High JSD, Low Entropy seed, however sampling error in shorter sequences was a feature of all seeds (Figure \ref{fig:synthetic/T50/all-seeds}). }
