\caption{\textbf{The $\hat\delta_\nabla$ statistic increased with a marker of historic disequilibrium.} The scatter plots shows magnitude of disequilibrium measure by $\hat\delta_\nabla$ and the JSD between ingroup taxa for the observed Microbial data set. The Microbial data set comprises 9702 alignments where the level of disequilibrium is expected to vary.}
