\caption[Humans exhibit a higher proportion of mutation disequilibrium in CDS compared to introns]{\textbf{Humans exhibit a higher proportion of mutation disequilibrium in CDS compared to introns.} The Quantile-Quantile plots compare the distribution of $\hat p-$values to the expected uniform distribution. \textbf{(a)} 1,406 alignments of introns from human, chimpanzee and gorilla, \textbf{(b)}, 1,182 CDS alignments from human, chimpanzee and gorilla. For all model fitting human was the foreground edge. }
