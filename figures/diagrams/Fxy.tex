\caption{\textbf{Evolutionary History of \textit{Fxy} in Rodents}. \textbf{(a)} The \textit{Fxy} gene in \textit{M. musculus} was translocated from a X-specific position to a new position in which it overlaps with the PAR. The overlap in \textit{M. musculus} is shown as the shaded region of the gene, shown as a box. The divergence timescale is indicated in millions of years. In rodents and other mammals \textit{Fxy} is X-specific, suggesting translocation to the PAR in \textit{M. musculus} after divergence with \textit{M. spretus}, between 2-3 million years ago. \textbf{(b)} The structure of the \textit{Fxy} gene in \textit{M. musculus}. The $5'$ end of the gene, exons 1-3, are X-specific. The $3'$ end of the gene, exons 4-10, are positioned in the PAR. Note that for simplicity, exons beyond exon 7 are not shown in the structure. The boundary to the PAR falls in intron 3 of \textit{Fxy} \citep{Palmer1997AMice}. The phylogeny in (a) is adapted from Figure 1 in \cite{Galtier2007AdaptationEvolution}}
